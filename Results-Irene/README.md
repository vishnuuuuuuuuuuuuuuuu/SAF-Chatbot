# Results-Irene Contents  
Because of the random nature of the generation part of the RAG models, the same code (found at models_and_evaluation_irene.py) has been run five times.  
In this folder, the results of each run can be found in two formats:  
- .json files, which contain the actual generated answers from each model for every question;  
- .png files, which show the evaluation scores and total runtime for each run

For the evaluation presented in the thesis, each score and the total runtime of each model have been averaged in order to get a more accurate analysis.
