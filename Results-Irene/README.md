Because of the random nature of the generation part of the RAG models, the same code (found at models_and_evaluation_irene.py) has been run five times.  
In this folder, the results of each run can be found in two formats:  
- .json files, which contain the actual generated answers from each model for every question;  
- .png files, which show the evaluation scores for each run
