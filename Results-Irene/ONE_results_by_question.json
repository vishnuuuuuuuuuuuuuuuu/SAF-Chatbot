This exploration laid the groundwork for future advancements in their SAF initiatives (source: Emirates Group Annual Report 2023-2024, page 14).\n\n2. **Progress in Subsequent Years (2021-2022)**: The documents do not specify annual SAF consumption figures for 2021 and 2022. However, it is implied that Emirates was still in the early stages of integrating SAF into their operations during these years, focusing on partnerships and agreements to enhance their SAF supply chain (source: Emirates Group Annual Report 2023-2024, page 14).\n\n3. **Significant Increase in 2023**: In 2023, Emirates made substantial strides in its SAF consumption. They signed new supply agreements that allowed for the uplift of SAF at their Dubai hub for the first time, as well as in Amsterdam and Singapore. Notably, Emirates operated the first A380 demonstration flight using 100% SAF in one engine, which was a significant milestone in their sustainability efforts. This uplift of SAF contributed to emissions reductions of approximately 4,700 tonnes of CO2e over the lifecycle of the fuel (source: Emirates Group Annual Report 2023-2024, page 14).\n\n4. **Future Commitments (2024 and Beyond)**: Looking ahead, Emirates has committed to further increasing its SAF consumption, with plans to supply over 3 million gallons of SAF in 2024 and 2025 for flights departing from Amsterdam Schiphol and Singapore Changi airports (source: Emirates Group Annual Report 2023-2024, page 14). This commitment indicates a strategic shift towards integrating SAF more deeply into their operations.\n\n5. **Investment in Research and Development**: In May 2023, Emirates established a US$ 200 million fund to support research and development projects focused on reducing the impact of fossil fuels in commercial aviation. This fund has been allocated to various initiatives, including partnerships with organizations like the Aviation Impact Accelerator at the University of Cambridge (source: Emirates Group Annual Report 2023-2024, page 14).\n\nIn summary, Emirates' SAF usage has evolved from initial exploration in 2020 to significant operational milestones in 2023, with ambitious plans for further increases in the coming years.
