# Code-Irene Description  
In this python notebook five RAG query translation techniques have been defined: Naive, Decomposition (Indivudually and Recursively answered), RAG-Fusion, and HyDE.  
For the advanced techniques, the codes provided by LangChain in the repository https://github.com/langchain-ai/rag-from-scratch.git have been adapted in the context of airlines' sustainability reports.  

For the evaluation of these techniques, the RAGAs library has been used. Specifically, the three metrics Answer Correctness, Context Recall, and Faithfulness.
