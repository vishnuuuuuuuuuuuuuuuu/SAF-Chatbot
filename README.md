This repository has the scope of gathering all the data, methods, and results of our research as a group.  
  
The preprocessig step, studied by Vishnu R., can be found at Vishnu pre-processing. This contains the code used to transform the multi-format PDF reports into structured JSON files. In these files the tables and graphs are transformed into text, and the text is split into chunks of a size that is easily readable by the RAG system.  
The query translation step, studied by Irene S., can be found at Code-Irene, Evaluation-Irene, and Results-Irene. These folders conatin respectively the code used to define the techniques studied and evaluate them, the datasets used to evaluate these techniques, adn the results of the evaluations.  
The prompt engineering step, studied by Ernest K., can be found at Ernest-Prompt. This contains the code used to define the methods studied and evaluate them, the dataset used to evaluate these techniques, and the results obtained from the evaluation.  
  
To wrap up our reseach, a chatbot has been built. The code for it and its description can be found at Chatbot.
